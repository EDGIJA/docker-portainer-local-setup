# 🐳 Portainer Local GUI Launcher (Without Docker Desktop)

This repository contains a minimal and efficient installation for managing Docker on Linux systems (such as Ubuntu) without relying on Docker Desktop.

It includes:
- Clean installation of Docker Engine
- Portainer container with automatic restart
- Script to launch Portainer and open a browser
- System menu integration via `.desktop`
- Auto-run option at login

> Ideal for those looking for control, customization, and lightness.


## 📦 Installation
> Recommended to ensure everything works correctly, but if Docker Engine is already installed, it is not a prerequisite.
```bash
chmod +x instalar_docker.sh
./instalar_docker.sh
```

## 🐳 Initialize Portainer
```bash
chmod +x ~/portainer_start.sh
./portainer_start.sh
```
